If you want to test the other cases out, just find the case you want to test out and copy the number into the array in the program. Also if the program simulate it too fast you can change the speed by changing the t in the constructor just the number that is getting divided by FRAME_RATE

The array order goes like 
Blue Postion Array
Orange Position Array
Position Order Array
